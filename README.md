## Maple Syrup Production Predictor
The code implements a VAR model to predict the production quantity of Maple Syrup from Jan 2021 - Dec 2021 taking precipitation, soil moisture, temperature and NDVI into account.
- Production Quantity.csv: Production quantity of Maple Syrup in tonnes at monthly frequency
- Daily Precipitation.csv: Precipitation quantity (in mm) at daily frequency
- Daily Soil Moisture.csv: Soil Moisture at 5cm depth (measured by the ratio Vol/Vol) at daily frequency
- Daily Temperature.csv: Average daily temperature on the surface of the land (in celsius) at daily frequency
- Eight Day NDVI.csv: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI is a ratio which ranges between [-1, 1] and captures the vegetation abundance of an area) at 8 day frequency
